<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hello I am Lucas Joolen. I was born on the 8th of may in Brussels the capital of Belgium.<br/>
  

</p>

<p>
  When I was younger I never tought I would end up working behind a computer.(except for when I was 13, just learned about anonymous and wanted to become a hacker&#128517;)<br/>
  But when I was 19 and started to travel on my own my eyes opened to the possibilities with a computer.<br/>
  So i started learning python, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and a lot of other coding languages <br/>
  because this would allow me to start working remotely and traveling all around the world while having a secure job from my computer.<br/>
